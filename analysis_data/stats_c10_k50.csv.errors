GPU 4: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 776.00 MiB. GPU 4 has a total capacity of 79.11 GiB of which 580.94 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 78.53 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 56.48 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 21.39 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management  (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)
